# MkDocs Simple Plugin

A plugin for MkDocs that builds a documentation website from markdown content interspersed within your code, in markdown files or in block comments in your source files.

To summarize its operation briefly, `simple` will search your project directory tree for documentation. By default, Markdown files and graphics files will be copied to your documentation site. In addition, source files will be searched for markdown embedded in minimally-structured comment blocks; such content will be extracted into additional markdown files included in the documentation site.

## Installation

Install the plugin with pip.

```bash
pip install mkdocs-simple-plugin
```

_Python 3.x, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 supported._

### Plugin usage

Create a `mkdocs.yml` file in the root of your directory and add the `simple` plugin to its plugin list.

The example YAML below shows all of the configuration parameters for the plugin, their default values, and their meanings. Note that the parameter controlling the extraction of markdown from source files is called "semiliterate" because this facility goes partway toward providing a literate programming environment in Donald Knuth's sense: code and documentation can be interleaved, with the appropriate parts extracted by different tools. (However, this package does not provide full literate programming support, in that it does not give documentation the primary organizational role and provide tools to reorganize the code blocks into interpretable or compilable form; rather, it allows you to extract the documentation blocks and arrange them into readable form.)

```yaml
site_name: your_site_name
plugins:
  - simple:
      # Only directories whose name (final path component) matches a "glob"
      # pattern in this list will be searched for documentation:
      include_folders: ["*"]
      # In addition, directories whose name matches a glob pattern in this
      # list will NOT be searched for documentation.
      ignore_folders: []
      # Hidden directories will not be searched if this is true:
      ignore_hidden: True
      # If the following is true, the contents of the docs directory (if any)
      # will be merged at the same level as all other documentation, i.e., the
      # docs directory prefix of these files will be elided. Otherwise, the docs
      # directory will be searched like all other directories, i.e., the docs
      # directory prefix will be kept:
      merge_docs_dir: True
      # Any file in the searched directories whose name contains a string in
      # this list will simply be copied to the generated documentation:
      include_extensions: [".tif", ".tiff", ".gif", ".jpeg", ".jpg", ".jif", ".jfif",
            ".jp2", ".jpx", ".j2k", ".j2c", ".fpx", ".pcd", ".png", ".pdf", "CNAME"]
      # The dicts in the following list specify which other files will be
      # scanned for embedded documentation and how. The first entry in the list
      # gives all of the keys allowed in an entry, with their meanings and
      # default values. The remaining entries in the list actually constitute
      # the default value of the "semiliterate" parameter:
      semiliterate:
          # Any file in the searched directories which did not match the
          # "include_extensions" and whose name contains this
          # required regular expression parameter will be scanned:
        - pattern: None
          # By default, the extracted documentation will be copied to a file
          # whose name is generated by replacing the last matching group
          # in the "pattern" parameter with `.md`. However, if the following
          # parameter is specified, it will be expanded as a template using
          # the match object from matching "pattern" against the filename,
          # to produce the name of the extracted file:
          destination: None
          # Lines from the scanned file will be ignored until a line
          # containing this required regular expression parameter is
          # encountered. As with the other parameters ("stop" and "terminate")
          # controlling extraction, the last matching group in the "start"
          # expression, if any, will be written to the extracted file.
          # Subsequent lines, possibly with the transformations specified
          # by the "replace" parameter below, will be written to the
          # extracted file.
          start: None
          # Whenever a line containing this optional regexp is encountered,
          # copying to the extracted file will be suspended until the next
          # occurrence of "start" (if any) is encountered:
          stop: None
          # If specified, all extraction from the file is terminated when
          # a line containing this regexp is encountered. Note that if
          # "terminate" occurs before "start" nothing will be extracted
          # from the file.
          terminate: None
          # A list of regexp substitutions to be attempted on all other
          # extracted lines of the file, not matching any of the above.
          # See additional documentation for details.
          replace: []
        # Default python embedded documentation, in marked docstrings or
        # other marked triple-quoted strings:
        - pattern: '(\.py)$'
          start: '"""\smd'
          stop: '"""'
        # Default block-comment embedded documentation in other source files:
        - pattern: '(\.[^.]*)$'
          start: '/\*\*\smd'
          stop: '\*\*/'
```

To summarize, the default values for the simple plugin engender the following
behavior: All markdown and graphics files will be copied to the documentation
tree "as is." Any file with the `.py` extension will have all lines between
ones that contain `""" md` and `"""` extracted to a new corresponding `.md`
file. And any files with any other extension will have all lines between
occurrences of `/** md` and `**/` extracted to a new `.md` file.

#### Extraction with replacement

The `replace` parameter of a `semiliterate` dict allows the ordinary extracted
lines from a file to be transformed in simple ways by regular expressions.
(The "ordinary" extracted lines are all those that are copied into the
extracted file, other than the lines matching the start, stop, or terminate
patterns.) One possible use of `replace` is to strip leading line-comment
symbols from documentation embedded in such places as YAML files that only
have line comments, rather than block comments. Here are the details:

The `replace` parameter is a list of substitutions to attempt. Each substitution
is specified either by a two-element list of a (Python) regular expression and a
template, or by just a regular expression. In each line that `simple` extracts,
the regular expression from each substitution in turn is searched for.
If none match, the line is transcribed unchanged. However, for the first one
that matches, the template expanded by the Python Match.expand function
(using the successful match object) is transcribed in place of the line.
If there is no template, then just the last matching group is transcribed
if there is one, or nothing at all is transcribed if there is no last
matching group. This latter convention makes it easy to selectively drop
lines that contain a given regular expression. Note that once one of the
`replace` patterns matches, processing stops; no further expressions
are checked.

### Build

Then, you can build the mkdocs from the command line.

```bash
mkdocs build
```

### Run a local server

One of the best parts of mkdocs is the ability to serve (and update!) your documentation site locally.

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
