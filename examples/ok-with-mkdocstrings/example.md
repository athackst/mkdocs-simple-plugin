# Example

The extracted [module documentation](module.md) includes the documentation from the module header, and has invoked mkdocstrings to render api documentation based on Python docstrings.

Compare the webpage linked above with the raw `module.md` generated
by extraction from `module.py`:

```
{% include "examples/ok-with-mkdocstrings/module.md" %}
```
