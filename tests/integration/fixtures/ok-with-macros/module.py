## Python Version

You can put _markdown_ in triple-quoted strings in Python.

You can even use macros to inject other markdown here!

For example, here's the readme file:

{% include 'README.md' %}

"""


def main():
    """
    This is a test function.  It takes no paramers.

    It says "Hello, world!"
    """
    print("Hello, world!")
    return 0
