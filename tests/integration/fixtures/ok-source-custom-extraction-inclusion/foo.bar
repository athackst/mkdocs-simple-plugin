Description: This is a hypothetical file of the bar language
Explanation: It doesn't really make sense
---
## Exposition

However, we can use it to test custom extraction
---

Information: This is a supposed "source code" section.
Point: This should be ignored by semiliterate extraction.

---
And other features, such as extraction resumption.

Not to mention{! baz.qux start: START
terminate: STOP
replace: ['^\|(.*)$'] !}syntax and `{! escaped syntax !}`.
---

Unfortunate: the bar language has no real structure

!!!

---
But at least this stuff down here will go ignored
