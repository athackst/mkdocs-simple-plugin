You will need to have [MKDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) installed on your system.
I recommend installing it via pip to get the latest version.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
 python3-pip \
 libcairo2-dev \
 libfreetype6-dev \
 libffi-dev \
 libjpeg-dev \
 libpng-dev \
 libz-dev
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```
