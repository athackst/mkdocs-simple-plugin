# This example shows how to set up custom extraction modes. Litcoffee files
# consist of interspersed Markdown and Coffeescript code. The pattern
# defined here extracts a documentation page from each such file, consisting of:
# everything from the beginning of the file to the first line of code
# (a line indented by at least four spaces), together with any later Markdown
# block preceded by a comment containing `# DOCPAGE`.
#
# Similarly, you may want to have to have a custom extraction even for a
# standard file pattern, or for one particular file; the `drone.yml` pattern
# could for example extract development documentation from a Drone yml file.
# Note this latter pattern takes advantage of the fact that you can have just
# a single top-level block of parameters in an `extract:` section.
