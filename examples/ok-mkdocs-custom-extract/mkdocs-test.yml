# This example shows how to set up custom extraction modes. Litcoffee files
# consist of interspersed Markdown and Coffeescript code. The pattern
# defined here extracts a documentation page from each such file, consisting of:
# everything from the beginning of the file to the first line of code
# (a line indented by at least four spaces), together with any later Markdown
# block preceded by a comment containing `# DOCPAGE`.
